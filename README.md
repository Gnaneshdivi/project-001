Hello, this is Team ~Binary, We believe in a very easy, simple, and layman's life. So the projects we design are totally amateur about the complexities but mature about the use case. With this description of the team, we introduce you to our work B1- project001.

# Inspiration
Web3 ecosystem as a whole visualizes to see a world running on web3 technologies but it is one of the composite technologies existing in this era. Everyone is interested in utilizing the strength given by blockchain. Developers have been working on this vigorously to transform complex applications into easily accessible platforms.
In this process of innovation, our team was hit by the idea, Introducing a single point of payment (SPP) which is handling all the web2 and web3 payments from a single address. This will increase the user adoption of blockchain and help transform major payment flow on the chain which ensures the stability of the currency and easy shipment.

# How is B1 different!!!
We hear at B1 work on making the payment process simple and quick. Users do not need to use multiple p2p platforms, wallets, or exchanges all the functionalities are embedded into B1 using web3 and UPI. B1 bypasses boundaries between users on web3 and web2 space to make payments. The remitter and beneficiary can use both wallet and UPI but they will have to set up primary debiting and crediting accounts which will enable B1 to opt to flow transactions from crypto wallet to UPI or vice-versa. This flexibility to just choose the method, B1 makes the magic for you.
Can process crypto wallet to crypto wallet, crypto wallet to UPI, Upi to crypto wallet, UPI to UPI
- Provides a single point or payment for the whole payment system.
- Can make payment from any source to any source (web2 wallet, web3 wallets, UPI)
- Can be directly integrated with any PA/PGs which extends the boundaries of payments to crypto payments on any webpages.
- Provides open-end APIs for tailored use cases.
- Can we access from chatbots 
- The transactions are indexed to Graph, which helps the community to build and utilize the data.


## Specialties 
There is another special use case handled where the beneficiary is not compulsory to be onboarded to B1. 

# Approach
The wallet has utilization through APIs like authenticate, transfer, request, request QR code, and check status. These APIs will be available for application in testing and working on production in the B1 environment. The Remitter or the payer can log in and add configurations to his IDs on the B1 webpage. The webpage consists of a config setup for the botâ€™s permissions, set limits, set default accounts, and other functionalities. These help users from any background easily understand and make their configurations as per their requirements. To avail of the integration the organizations have to get access to the sandbox and utilize the testing environment.

# Challenges we faced 
Setup fund transfers between mediums.
Utilizing cryptographic methods for security on the application.

# Future Builds
- Develop UI for the B1 webpage and add functionalities 
- Extending the web app functionalities to the integration level, leveraging powerful integrations for P2P applications.
- Kyc using live peer video streaming 
- Utilizing Superfluid for Subscription based payments
