# ~Binary
Hello, this is Team ~Binary, We believe in a very easy, simple, and layman's life. So the projects we design are totally amateur about the complexities but mature about the use case. With this description of the team, we introduce you to our work B1- project001.

# Inspiration
Web3 ecosystem as a whole visualizes to see a world running on web3 technologies but it is one of the composite technologies existing in this era. Everyone is interested in utilizing the strength given by blockchain. Developers have been working on this vigorously to transform complex applications into easily accessible platforms.
In this process of innovation, our team was hit by the idea ,Introducing single point of payments (SPP) which is basically handling all the web2 and web3 payments from a single address.This will increase the user adoption to blockchain and help transform major payment flow on chain which ensures stability of currency and easy shipment.

# How is B1 different!!!
We hear at B1 work on making the payment process simple and quick.Users do not need to use multiple p2p platforms, wallets,exchanges all the functionalities are embedded into B1 using web3 and UPI. B1 bypasses boundaries between users on web3 and web2 space to make payments. The remitter and beneficiary can use both wallet and upi but they will have to set up primary debiting and crediting accounts which will enable B1 to opt to flow transactions from crypto wallet to UPI or vice-versa. This flexibility to just choose the method, B1 makes the magic for you.
